168I remember being so impressed, with the youth programs of the other parishes in my area, and the stong bond that everyone had withen their own groups, regardless of the social status of each person.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
173There were also other various events that I ended up doing on my own, due to the lack of interest from others in my group.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
175There were national events for Catholic youth that were able to attend, religious retreats, missionary work, and myself and a very few others were selected to goto a Christian leadership program that was offered at the time.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : anger
176See, the whole time that I was trying to develop my own faith, attending events with other parishes, and all the work I did with my own group.

221I had never been to this particular hostel before, and as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along, I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents, but rather a few dull, glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
222As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : anger
229It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
243And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
245You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
249But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
251This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'.

262It took us about two hours to get out there, and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
263And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset, as the red orb of  the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
266Not bad.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
269And they weren't kidding.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
272Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse.

273They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
277Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
280The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week.

   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
355Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major, there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
357In addition to that, we keep encountering classes where the professor expects you to have taken general classes that you haven't (the anatomy/physiology is one, and thermodynamics is another one that Matt is having a problem with).
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
358I need to find a good time/place where I can go pray and unwind.

447I had "Stars Don't Shine" stuck in my head earlier, and started singing it aloud to try and figure out what song it was, until I realized, too late, that it was Paris Hilton.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
449But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy

   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
462We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
465By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
467It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
468Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others.

   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy

1174As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters.

1175An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks, however, has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th.

1179Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly.

1283I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
1284Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
1285Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex?

1365That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards, didn't partake of any post-show gatherings, and missed a big chunk of panels.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
1369I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1370There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
1371Still, the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables, downstairs were the talks and trophies.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1372Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby.

1382Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : fear

   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1773Middle Ages (450 A.D. to 1450 A.D): Shortly after the fall of the Roman Empire, the first era of classical music was born.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
1774There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
1783Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1788You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing "classical").
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1789They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material.

1791Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions.

1813Arguments in opposition: 20
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
18148 of the "pro" arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : anger
1815Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : anger
1816There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
1817All in all, most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : anger
1818One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton.

1967Then again, I'm not a good judge of art.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
1968As an aside, there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as Body Worlds (I guess the entire affair has sparked various "knock-off" exhibits!)
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
1970While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students (someone has to do the dirty work) there have been some controversies, and questions as to where the cadavers come from.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
1971The creator of "Body Worlds" has denied that his specimines have been acquired in any dubious manner, and has documentation to that effect.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad

2007Then I guess my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor.

2009It's because of thing called "vasovagal syncope" and was triggered because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous.

2041It's a bit more satisfying this time than most since I'm now past the second of the three major problem classes I identified when I first got back into school.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2042I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things, so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2043However, there are several things I know full well I've been between mediocre and bad at in the past- theoretical math, foreign languages, public speaking.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2044So far that's turned out to be little problem- I believe I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
2045What's more, I could tell the subjects themselves were coming to me much easier than they did, say, 5 years ago- so it wasn't simply a matter of more lax evaluation.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
2047I've always been aware that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level, and so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas.

2120Pete Rose runs over Indians catcher, Ray Fosse to score the winning run of the 1970 All Star Game.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2126We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
2129I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2131I came racing down the line as Ryan Shalek picked up the loose ball and fired a strike to home plate.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2139You just have to think though of the consequences when two people meet at one point in that vicious a nature.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2143Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse, the Indians' seemingly promising beacon, is never the same ball player.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2144So, in the end, we held on to win by a score of 18-13.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2145Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2146That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2147There is nothing like being in a train wreck at home plate especially if you hang on to the ball for the out.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2148Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : fear
2150There is usually one good hit each season and that is it.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2151Joe said the only sensation going through his body when he hit the ground was that he had to go to the bathroom badly.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : disgust
2157As I threw one of the pitches back to Billy, Joe broke for home plate.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2158I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2159I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me. He bounced off me and rolled behind home plate.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2161I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won, 7-6.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2163He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : sad
2166Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home.

2191Now I need to find a place to put all my stuff at Andrea's. I know my DVD shelf would have no problem finding a place in the livingroom, but the computer, the bed, the dresser, and my electronics would need to find a home in my room.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
2193There's no way I could put my chairs there, and I don't want to trash em, I would like to give them to a friend or something at the least.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2198I was kind of confused.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : surprise
2199as when I asked the representative, they said that as long as I paid my 400 dollars, I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of my costs until OSAP made a decision, and until then, I could go ahead, schedule, and do my thing.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : fear

2229I have the choice to either go to this Burgessville Rocks thing, go to London to watch movies with the Furries, or go to Brantford with Jason to sling some haybales and make some more cash (oh yeah, Tim owes me like 30 bucks too, on top of the 60 in my bank) so apparently I do well with the cash.
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
2234Anyway, the smart part of me says to go to Jason's, make some cash, get stronger, get ready and train my leg to be stronger (like I did on my bike.)
   Aman's value : neutral  Our value : happy
