607I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever.

610Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it.

614I know I'm guilty of that all the time.
   Aman's value : sad  Our value : neutral
617It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : sad
618I can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way.

632This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1.5 hours each way, every day to go to work, I go to the gym more than he does, I cook my meals, I have a life, and I have a house to look after.

   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : neutral
636I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy "I don't have to do anything" option.
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : happy
637But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy.

897How disgusting would it be to see 9/11 turn into a 'market'?
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : neutral
898And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life?
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : neutral
899And, I do ask, who profited from 9/11 in the first place?
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : neutral
900The answers are dispicable.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : sad
901Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption?

902The selling of top secret documents to profit off of the killing of 150 people in a mosque?

   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : sad
904It is sickening.

916I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing.
   Aman's value : happy  Our value : sad
918In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber.
   Aman's value : sad  Our value : neutral
921The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art.
   Aman's value : surprise  Our value : neutral
923However, for me, the more "artistic" exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : surprise
925I'm still being bothered by the craziest smells.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : anger

934It looks like somebody puked up several golds and pinks, and then pasted it on a canvas.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : neutral
939and im not trying to be mean but if i say i dislike someone and you are like "why why why" and i try to explain but you're just like "thats stupid you shouldnt dislike her" it pisses me off if i have to defend myself for disliking someone.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : happy
944i consider myself a nice person and i should have the right to dislike some people.

948The second day I went in and I was so paranoid.
   Aman's value : fear  Our value : neutral
949OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded, I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything.

961I finally snapped and yelled out the door at the last two "DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE??"
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : neutral
964While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free (I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he can't even take care of his hands), I cannot say the same for others, and cannot vouch for where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have, such as the toilet seat, flush lever, and door handles.
   Aman's value : fear  Our value : sad
965Hey assholes, explain to your children where their cold sores came from: "Daddy didn't wash his hands in the restroom, then he cleaned the ketchup off your face, and now you have herpes."
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : neutral
966Wash your damned hands.

972The movie itself sucked.
   Aman's value : disgust  Our value : neutral
974The plot was just full of loopholes, there wasn't even any gratuitous boobage that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women.
   Aman's value : anger  Our value : neutral
975But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through.
