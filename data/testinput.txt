This was the best summer I haven't ever experienced.
I've found it but I've also found other tunnels.
Good night friends!!
See yaaaa tomarrow my friends.
The tingling of my fingers.
The fog that replaces my brain.
Almost past the tv.
I can only imagine my face looks like those people who try to throw their soul away.
I hate fucking pills.
I just came back yesterday from California.
I had a blast in california hanging out with my family and friends.
Thank you to everyone who made me feel at home.
I stayed at my best friends Ginny's house.

So many lies about who you're talking to, where you're going, what you're doing.
The people that just have to send a "hug" and it puts a smile on your face.
You don't know their middle name or the age of their sister
